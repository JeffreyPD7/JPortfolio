hint of Web Design, that fell in Love with Debian Linux Distros. I started my studies in
Computer Science on 2011, beginning with the C# language. I then transitioned
working on Java, to C and C++, and afterward to web development languages. My
studies started at Middlesex Community College under the Computer Science degree.
I then transferred to the University of Massachusetts Lowell, where I proceeded my
studies with a minor in robotics. I have taken the core courses that focus on
logic and Object-Oriented Programming. Besides web development, my heart is at
Internet of Things, Robotics, and Data; and hope to find a position where all ends
